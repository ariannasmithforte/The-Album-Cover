# The-Album-Cover
Using p5.js, I created one of my favorite albums, "A Seat at the Table" by Solange because my favorite song, "Cranes in the Sky" is on the album. "Cranes in the Sky" by Solange is such a calming song for me, and the whole album represents a part of my teenage years. The work I made replicates the album cover. My favorite part of the album cover is the pink and blue hair clips, which I loved to where when I was little.

Instructions: Press the "space" to start the song, and press the "p" button to pause the song. Press "a" and "b" to change the blue clips pink and back to blue. Press "c" and "d" to change the pink clips, blue and back to pink. Press the right and left arrows to juggle one of the music notes. Press the up and down arrow to juggle the other music note.
